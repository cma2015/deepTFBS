## Introduction

- **PEA-m6A** is  an ensemble learning framework for predicting m<sup>6</sup>A modifications at regional-scale. PEA-m6A consists of four modules: **Sample Preparation, Feature Encoding, Model Development and Model Assessment**, each of which contains a comprehensive collection of functions with pre-specified parameters available.
- The PEA-m6A project is hosted on https://github.com/cma2015/PEA-m6A.
- The PEA-m6A Docker image can be obtained from https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/peam6a.

## How to use PEA-m6A
