## Introduction

- **deepTFBS** takes advantages of **multi-task learning** technique to integrate large-scale TF binding profiles for **pre-training**, and is capable of leveraging knowledge from pre-trained models via **transfer learning**, representing an innovation in that it can improve prediction accuracy of **TFBS** under small-sample training and cross-species prediction tasks.
- The deepTFBS project is hosted on http://omicstudio.cloud:4019/deepTFBS/.
- The deepTFBS Docker image can be obtained from https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/deeptfbs.
